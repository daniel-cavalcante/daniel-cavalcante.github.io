    <h2>What is this web page about?</h2>
    
    <p>
      In brazilian portuguese, or simply <em>portuguese</em>, there is the expression "(eu tô) de boa na lagoa". Sometimes, while trying to express myself in english, I felt the need to use this particular expression. As far as I know, there is no english equivalent which preserves the rhymes, so I decided to create this webpage which contains my personal english translation of "de boa na lagoa" and a bunch of memes in a attempt to popularize this expression among my english fluents friends.
