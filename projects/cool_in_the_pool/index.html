    <h2 id="introduction">What is this web page about?</h2>
    
    <p>
      In brazilian portuguese, or simply <em>portuguese</em>, there is the expression <q>(eu tô) de boa na lagoa</q>. Sometimes, while trying to express myself in english, I felt the need to use this particular expression. As far as I know, there is no english equivalent which preserves the rhymes, so I decided to create this webpage which contains my personal english translation of <abbr title="de boa na lagoa">DBNL</abbr> and a bunch of memes in a attempt to popularize this expression among my english fluents friends.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this page you will find:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The meaning of <q>de boa na lagoa</q> and how it is used;</li>
      <li>The translation;</li>
      <li>Some memes with a dog floating in the pool;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="meaning">The meaning of the expression.</h2>
    <p>
      According to <a href="https://www.dicionarioinformal.com.br/" title="DicionárioInformal's homepage" target="_blank">Dicionário Informal</a>, a portuguese analogue of the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/" title="UrbanDictionary's homepage" target="_blank">Urban Dictionary</a>, <abbr>DBNL</abbr> intends to express  well-being and relaxation. One could say <q>Today I'm cool in the pool!</q> or <q>C in the P, bro!</q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>A few fun facts follows.</strong> The <q>de boa na lagoa</q> may also refer to:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>  <abbr>DBNL</abbr> is the name of a hotel located in São Lourenço do Sul, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.</li>
      <li> <q>de boa na lagoa</q> is the name of at least three songs on a popular <a href="https://www.letras.mus.br/" title="Letras homepage" target="_blank">song lyrics web site</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="translation">The translation.</h2>

    <p>The expression <q>de boa na lagoa</q> has a rhyme. For this reason alone, the chosen translation is <em>Cool... In the Pool</em>. I feel complete again.

    <h2 id="memes">The memes.</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a dog which is clearly C in da P.

    </p>
    
    <p>
      And here is the base image with inverted colors as an attempt to express something that is <em>not</em> right.
